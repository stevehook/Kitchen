        title: Authentic Indian cooking
        text: Zanzaneet brings you recipes and tips to introduce you to real Indian cooking.
              What you won't find here is recipes to reproduce the flavours of your local curry house.
              Instead we aim to show you how to bring the authentic regional Indian cooking into your home.

        text: Zanzaneet is all about our own style of home cooking. We like to
              eat well and we like to eat healthy, but we never want to compromise on the
              flavour. When you visit Web site we hope that you will find ideas that will
              infect you with our love of good food and inspire you to cook some of our
              favourite dishes.

        title: Authentic Indian cooking
        text: Zanzaneet is a Marathi word used to describe spicy, vibrant and flavourful food.
              Much of our inspiration is drawn from traditional Indian home
              cooking, far removed from your local curry house. We would love to introduce
              you to some of the authentic recipes we grew up with. But if Indian food is not
              to your taste we have recipes from other parts of the world.

        title: Finish your greens
        text: At Zanzaneet we believe in healthy eating and green living. We
              donâ€™t eat meat and fish every day so you will find plenty of tasty vegetarian
              recipes here as well as a few dishes for non-vegetarians. Whatever the
              ingredients our food is always satisfying, every meal from the Zanzaneet
              kitchen should be a feast for the senses.

        text: Zanzaneet brings you recipes and tips to introduce you to real Indian cooking.
              What you won't find here is recipes to reproduce the flavours of your local curry house.
              Instead we aim to show you how to bring the authentic regional Indian cooking into your home.
